# LanguageLeap
An iOS/Android app for learning a new language! Simply take a picture of what you'd you like to learn the translation of. Using Google Vision's object detection and Google Translate you can quickly translate whatever you take a picture of into Spanish, French, or German and earn points for guessing the correct translation.
